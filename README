GCHelper

GCHelper is a class that easily facilitates and wraps the actions of the Turn-Based Gaming APIs, and Game Center player authentication.

GCHelper is a singleton, and therefore only one will ever be created.  It also means that it can be accessed from anywhere that imports its header.

To authenticate a user, call:

[[GCHelper sharedInstance] authenticateLocalUser];

Implement the GCHelperDelegate in order to receive information and notifications about the turn-based matchmaking and gaming.
